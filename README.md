# myportfolio

Welcome to **myportfolio!** I made this site during my time as a
Full Stack Web Development Immersive student at General Assembly in Atlanta, Ga.
in 2017. I chose Bootstrap because when you're going to school full-time
you don't have the luxury of making a fully responsive site with all the bells
and whitles. I would much rather make a site from the ground up then use any
template but Bootstrap is great at making rapid prototypes and deliverables...deliverable.

I made all of the graphic design elements as well as the animations
with just plain old vanilla CSS. This is my first portfolio site and look forward
to making another as my skills become stronger and talents more refined.

I used Boostrap components as a scaffold and removed the Bootstrap classes
that were unnecessary to further customize the site.
